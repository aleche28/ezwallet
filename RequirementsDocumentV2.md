# Informal description

EZWallet (read EaSy Wallet) is a software application designed to help individuals and families keep track of their expenses. Users can enter and categorize their expenses, allowing them to quickly see where their money is going. EZWallet is a powerful tool for those looking to take control of their finances and make informed decisions about their spending. 

# Business model
The software project was taken over by a company that wants to make a profit on the app starting from the basic open source version found on github. To maintain the programmers and the engineers now working full time on the app they decided to sell some of the general analytics generated by the app to Google analytics.
The COO of the company has acceses to the app analytics and management.
